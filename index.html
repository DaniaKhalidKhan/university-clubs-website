          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Life at PAF-IAST is not all about academics and study, alone. We are well-aware of the need of extracurricular activities for the young students as a vital respite from their demanding academic responsibilities. It is essential to re-invigorate their energies and for the all-inclusive development of the students. It is a proven fact that teamwork and collaboration hold core importance in the 21st century skill set; and that is the underlying principle of student activities and engagement at PAF-IAST. Collaboration and community engagement is central to the establishment and operations of student societies at PAF-IAST. Student societies play a vital role in grooming the dormant potential of individuals, providing them the right forum and environment to express, compete, excel, and polish their abilities and transform into active and confident members of the society.</p>
